## Summary
In the past decades America has faced an unassuming killer that has taken countless lives of children, adults, teenagers and elders. Initially one may wish to cite diseases like the flu, heart disease or even cancer . And while each of those respective threats do claim hundreds of thousands of American lives on a yearly basis, they can all be traced back to one thing, personal health & maintenance. Many throughout the nation ignore their personal health and instead cram their faces with fast food and milkshakes, leading to increased blood pressure and increasing a persons risk to other deadly diseases. Additionally mental health realted issues have caused many to develop depression, anxiety and other mental health diseases. The combination of mental health disease and physical health disease has led to a decrease in the quality of life for many Americans. So in order to avoid these pitfalls in my own personal life, I propose a long term study on my own personal health data in order to gain a better understanding into the factors that effect my personal life.
